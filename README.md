##  A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms

This project presents a comparative study of four popular machine learning algorithms: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Tree**. The goal is to develop predictive models using a custom or publicly available dataset and evaluate the performance of each algorithm.

### Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset
* Preprocess data: handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables
* Implement and tune each ML algorithm using appropriate libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn`)
* Evaluate models using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**
* Conduct a comparative analysis to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model

###  Key Features

* Hyperparameter tuning with grid/randomized search (SVM, Decision Tree)
* Experimentation with different kernels (SVM) and distance metrics (KNN)
* Visualization of performance metrics (confusion matrices, plots, etc.)
* Decision tree structure visualization and interpretation

###  Deliverables

* A well-documented Jupyter Notebook containing:

  * Data exploration & preprocessing
  * Implementation & evaluation of each algorithm
  * Performance comparison & discussion
* Visualizations and insights summarizing model behavior
